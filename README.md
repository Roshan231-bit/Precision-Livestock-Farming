📌 Project Overview
Conventional cattle identification methods, such as ear tagging and RFID, present limitations, including susceptibility to tampering, potential harm to animals, and reliance on additional hardware. This project aims to overcome these challenges by utilizing the naturally unique muzzle patterns of cattle as a biometric trait for identification.

The system integrates multiple state-of-the-art components:

🧠 YOLOv11 for muzzle detection

🔍 ResNet50 for feature extraction and classification

⚡ FAISS for high-speed embedding-based similarity search

🌐 Web Interface for real-time user interaction and visualization

🚀 Motivation
Reliable cattle identification is critical for:

✅ Disease monitoring and biosecurity compliance

✅ Livestock traceability and theft prevention

✅ Efficient resource and welfare management

Muzzle pattern recognition offers a non-invasive, tamper-proof, and cost-effective solution that eliminates the need for physical tags or electronic devices.

📚 Literature Insights
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in learning fine-grained local texture features from muzzle images.

Transformer architectures contribute by modeling long-range dependencies, improving the recognition of complex patterns.

Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) has been proposed to effectively fuse local and global features, outperforming traditional techniques such as simple addition and concatenation, and achieving an accuracy of up to 99.88%.

Few-shot learning techniques enable the model to generalize effectively using as few as five images per cattle, making the system highly scalable.

📊 Datasets
Dataset	Size	No. of Classes
Cattle-1 [2]	2,632	300
Cattle-2 [3]	4,923	268
Cattle-3 [4]	2,893	459
Cattle-4	50	14

Cattle-4 is a custom-built dataset consisting of images collected from local farms.

🧩 Project Pipeline
✅ Step 1: Muzzle Detection
Train a YOLOv3/YOLOv11 model on manually annotated cattle face images to detect muzzle regions. Crop and extract these regions for downstream processing.

✅ Step 2: Biometric Identification
Fine-tune a ResNet50 model on cropped muzzle images to classify individual cattle.

✅ Step 3: Embedding and Similarity Search
Extract feature embeddings using the trained ResNet50 model and index them using FAISS for real-time image-based cattle search and verification.

✅ Step 4: Web-based Interface
Develop a lightweight web interface to demonstrate the full identification pipeline, allowing users to upload images, detect muzzles, and retrieve matching cattle identities.

✅ Step 5: Real-World Deployment
Collect live images from Gokulam farm, preprocess them, and adapt the trained models for on-field deployment using edge-compatible hardware.
